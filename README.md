# form-validation-practice
Practicing build a web form which collects Emai, Country, Zip Code, Password and Password Confirmation fields. It uses live inline validation to inform the user whether a field is properly filled in or not. That means highlightin a field red and providing a helpful error message until it has been filled in properly.
